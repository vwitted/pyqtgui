# pyqtgui

I wanted to play around with Qt and accessibility controls within Windows. This is mostly tinkering with using Qt framework with Python.

The script creates a small window whose opacity can be changed based on the cursor position to minimise distraction.

Text could be populated in a number lf way; providing magnification of selected text, for example. More ambitiously, a second thread can look up selected text and find snippets of code from code searches within github (this isn't really working right now).
