# pyqtgui

I wanted to play around with accessibility controls within Windows. This mostly tinkering project is a helper window using Qt. The window's opacity will change based on the cursor position to minimise user's distraction.
Text could be populated into the window for various reasons, providing magnification functionality. Or, more ambitiously, can look up selected text and find snippets of code from code searches within github (this isn't really working right now).
